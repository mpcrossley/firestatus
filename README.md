# firestatus
A very simple plugin for Wordpress to allow the Fire Chief (or anyone) to set a fire ban status.


## Installation

1. Install the plugin by cloning the repo to wp-content/plugins directory
2. Activate the plugin.

## How to use

### Setting Fire Status

If you only want to set the status from the admin page, simply set it from the wp-admin icon.

If you want to have a dedicated page for it, create a new page and add the short code:

[fire_ban_status_frontend]


### Displaying Current Status

On any page, add the short code:

[fire_ban_status]
